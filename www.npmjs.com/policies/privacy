<p>That depends on your personal situation, which is why you should read on
and decide for yourself. But at a minimum, absolutely every npm user
should understand:</p>
<p><em>The npm public registry is for making software available to everyone
online.</em></p>
<p>But: <em>Software comes from people, and says something about us.</em></p>
<p>So: <em>Think carefully about what packages to publish, what data you put
in those packages, and what others might do with that data.</em></p>
<p>When you create an account, certain contact information is displayed
publicly in the npm platform. And when you upload a package, your name
and contact information may become associated with that package.</p>
<p>If you find yourself in a jam, 
<a href="mailto:privacy@npmjs.com">email privacy@npmjs.com</a>.</p>
<h2 id="-a-id-collection-how-does-npm-collect-data-about-me-a-"><a id="collection">How does npm collect data about me?</a></h2>
<p>npm collects data about you:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>when you use the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm">npm command</a>, 
the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx">npx command</a> or another 
program to access the <a href="https://registry.npmjs.org/">npm public registry</a>, 
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/enterprise">Enterprise registries that npm hosts</a>, 
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/features">private packages</a>, 
such as when you&#39;re publishing a software package, and APIs for 
functionality like account and permissions management</p>
</li>
<li><p>when you browse the npm website, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npmjs.com</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>when you use either the npm command or the website to create an npm account, 
update your account, and sign up for npm services</p>
</li>
<li><p>when you send support, privacy, legal, and other requests to npm</p>
</li>
<li><p>when working with and researching current and potential customers</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When researching potential customers, npm staff sometimes search the
public World Wide Web or paid business databases. Otherwise, npm
doesn&#39;t buy or receive data about you from data brokers or other
private services.</p>
<p>npm may inadvertently collect data about you if it is included in
software packages that you or others upload.</p>
<h2 id="-a-id-data-what-data-does-npm-collect-about-me-and-why-a-"><a id="data">What data does npm collect about me, and why?</a></h2>
<h3 id="-a-id-usage-data-npm-collects-data-about-how-you-use-npm-software-and-registries-a-"><a id="usage-data">npm collects data about how you use npm software and registries.</a></h3>
<p>When you use the <code>npm</code> command, the <code>npx</code> command, or other software to work
with the npm public registry, an Enterprise registry that npm hosts, or
private packages, npm logs data that might be identified to you:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a random, unique identifier, called <code>npm-session</code>, for each time you
run commands like <code>npm install</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>the names and versions of your project&#39;s dependencies, their
dependencies, and so on, that come from the npm public registry,
<a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/audit">but not of other dependencies, like Git
dependencies</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>the versions of Node.js, the npm command, and the operating system
you are using</p>
</li>
<li><p>an <code>npm-in-ci</code> header, showing whether the command was run on a
continuous integration server</p>
</li>
<li><p>the scope of the package for which you ran <code>npm install</code>, as an
<code>npm-scope</code> header</p>
</li>
<li><p>a <code>referrer</code> header that shows the command you ran, with any file or
directory paths redacted</p>
</li>
<li><p>data about the software you&#39;re using to access the registry, such
as the <code>User-Agent</code> string</p>
</li>
<li><p>network request data, such as the date and time, your IP address,
and the URL</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>npm uses this data to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>fulfill your requests, such as by sending the packages you ask for</p>
</li>
<li><p>send you alerts about security vulnerabilities that may affect the
software you&#39;re building, when you run <code>npm install</code> or <code>npm audit</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>keep registries working quickly and reliably</p>
</li>
<li><p>debug and develop the <code>npm</code> command and other software</p>
</li>
<li><p>defend registries from abuse and technical attacks</p>
</li>
<li><p>compile statistics on package usage and popularity</p>
</li>
<li><p>prepare reports on trends in the developer community</p>
</li>
<li><p>improve search results on the website</p>
</li>
<li><p>recommend packages that may be relevant to your work</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-a-id-website-data-npm-collects-data-about-how-you-use-the-website-a-"><a id="website-data">npm collects data about how you use the website.</a></h3>
<p>When you visit <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">www.npmjs.com</a>,
<a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/">docs.npmjs.com</a>, and other npm
websites, npm uses cookies, server logs, and other methods to collect
data about what pages you visit, and when. npm also collects technical
information about the software and computer you use, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>your IP address</p>
</li>
<li><p>your preferred language</p>
</li>
<li><p>the web browser software you use</p>
</li>
<li><p>the kind of computer you use</p>
</li>
<li><p>the website that referred you</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>npm uses data about how you use the website to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>optimize the website, so that it&#39;s quick and easy to use</p>
</li>
<li><p>diagnose and debug technical errors</p>
</li>
<li><p>defend the website from abuse and technical attacks</p>
</li>
<li><p>compile statistics on package popularity</p>
</li>
<li><p>compile statistics on the kinds of software and computers visitors
use</p>
</li>
<li><p>compile statistics on visitor searches and needs, to guide
development of new website pages and functionality</p>
</li>
<li><p>decide who to contact about about product announcements, service
changes, and new features</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-a-id-account-data-npm-collects-account-data-a-"><a id="account-data">npm collects account data.</a></h3>
<p>Many features of npm services require an npm account. For example, you
must have an npm account to publish packages to the npm public registry.</p>
<p>To create an npm account, npm requires a working email address and an
available user name. npm uses this data to provide you access to
features and identify you across npm services, publicly and within npm.</p>
<p>You do not have to give your personal or legal name to create an npm
account. You can use a pseudonym instead. You can also open more than
one account.</p>
<p>If you sign up for an account, then npm will publish account data for
the whole world to see on user pages <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/~kemitchell">like this one</a>. 
npm also publishes account data through the npm public registry, 
which is available for everyone to see, and Enterprise registries that npm hosts for others to
find with commands like npm owner ls tap.</p>
<p>If you give npm a personal name or names on social media like
<a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and
<a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> through the website, like
when you include this on your profile or user page, npm publishes that
data along with the email address and user name for the account. You
don&#39;t have to give npm a personal name or any social media names, and
you can remove this data at any time by updating your user page.</p>
<p>npm uses your email to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>notify you about packages published using your account</p>
</li>
<li><p>reset your password and help keep your account secure</p>
</li>
<li><p>add metadata to packages that you publish</p>
</li>
<li><p>contact you in special circumstances related to your account or packages</p>
</li>
<li><p>contact you about support requests</p>
</li>
<li><p>contact you about legal requests, like DMCA takedown requests and privacy complaints</p>
</li>
<li><p>announce new npm product offerings, service changes, and features</p>
</li>
<li><p>send you tips about how to better use free and paid services</p>
</li>
<li><p>send you messages about paid services you might want</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-a-id-package-data-npm-collects-package-data-a-"><a id="package-data">npm collects package data.</a></h3>
<p>When you use npm publish or other software to publish packages to the
npm public registry, an Enterprise registry that npm hosts, or as a
private package, npm collects the contents of the package, plus
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata">metadata</a>,
including your account data. Other npm users may also publish packages
that include data about you, such as the fact that you contributed code
to a package.</p>
<p>npm uses data in packages to provide those packages to you and others
who request them:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When you publish a package to the npm public registry, or change a
package from private to public, npm makes the package and metadata
available to everyone, online.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When you publish a package to an Enterprise registry that npm hosts,
or as a private package, npm makes all of that data available to

account is configured. You may be able to configure who can access
the package, or that may be up to others, such as the
administrator of your company&#39;s Enterprise registry.</p>

<h3 id="-a-id-payment-data-npm-collects-payment-card-data-a-"><a id="payment-data">npm collects payment card data.</a></h3>
<p>To sign up for paid services, npm requires your payment card data. npm
itself does not collect or store enough information to charge your card
itself. Rather, <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> collects
that data on npm&#39;s behalf, and gives npm security tokens that allow npm
to create charges and subscriptions.</p>
<p>npm uses your payment card data only to charge for npm services.</p>
<p>npm instructs <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> to store your
payment card data only as long as you use paid npm services.</p>
<h3 id="-a-id-potential-customers-npm-collects-data-about-current-and-potential-customers-a-"><a id="potential-customers">npm collects data about current and potential customers.</a></h3>
<p>npm&#39;s sales and marketing teams collect information about npm users who
might like to try npm paid services, as individuals or through
organizations. npm also collects data about customer personnel, such as
lists of people who need Enterprise registry accounts or access to
channels for technical support. When npm&#39;s sales and marketing teams
send email to current and potential customers, they collect data about
whether those messages get read, and whether readers follow hyperlinks.</p>
<p>npm&#39;s sales team also uses public World Wide Web searches and paid
business databases to research who users work for, and their positions,
based on account data like name or email address. The vast majority of
this data is publicly available.</p>
<p>npm uses data about current and potential customer personnel to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>ensure npm meets its obligations to provide access, support, and
other services under contracts for paid services</p>
</li>
<li><p>decide which people to contact about product announcements, service
changes, and new features</p>
</li>
<li><p>ensure that people who opt out do not receive any more messages
about npm services and upgrades</p>
</li>
<li><p>keep track of how users express interest in npm products and
services over time</p>
</li>
<li><p>decide who should receive email about product announcements, service
changes, and new features</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-a-id-contact-data-npm-collects-data-about-correspondence-a-"><a id="contact-data">npm collects data about correspondence.</a></h3>
<p>npm collects data about you when you send npm support requests, legal
complaints, privacy inquiries, and business inquiries. Those data
usually include your name and email address, and may include your
company or other affiliation.</p>
<p>npm uses contact data to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>respond to you</p>
</li>
<li><p>compile aggregate statistics about correspondence</p>
</li>
<li><p>train support staff and other npm personnel</p>
</li>
<li><p>review the performance of npm personnel who respond</p>
</li>
<li><p>defend npm from legal claims</p>

<h3 id="-a-id-forum-data-npm-collects-data-about-use-of-npm-community-a-"><a id="forum-data">npm collects data about use of npm.community.</a></h3>
<p>npm collects data about visits, user accounts, and forum data on
<a href="https://npm.community/">npm.community</a>, the discussion
forum for users of npm products and services. npm uses data from
npm.community to collaborate with the development community, and to
inform development decisions about the command-line interface and other
software.</p>

<h2 id="-a-id-choice-how-can-i-make-choices-about-data-collection-a-"><a id="choice">How can I make choices about data collection?</a></h2>
<p>You choose what data the npm publish command includes in package data.
You can use an <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#files">.npmignore</a>
file in your package to keep specific files out of the package. You can
also use a <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#files">files list in package.json
files</a> to
instruct npm to include only specific files that you name, in addition
to standard files like <code>README</code> files, <code>LICENSE</code> files, and package.json.</p>
<p>To double check the data that you will share in a package that you plan
to publish, run the <code>npm publish --dry-run</code> command. If you are running
an older version of the npm command, run the npm pack command to create a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing%29">tarball</a>,
then check its contents, such as with <code>tar tvzf $tarball</code>.</p>
<p>To publish a package to the npm public registry, npm&#39;s terms of service
require you to <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/policies/open-source-terms#your-content">license npm to share it</a>.
If a package is made public, it is available for everyone online to see.
However, your <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#license">choice of public license for your package</a>
may affect what others can do with data about you in your package.</p>
<p>npm does not respond to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track">Do Not Track HTTP header</a>.</p>

rights and freedom related to data privacy. Information we collect may
be transferred to, and stored and processed in, the United States or any
other country in which we or our affiliates or subcontractors maintain
facilities, as described above.</p>
<p>If you reside in the EEA, Switzerland, or United Kingdom, you are

<p>npm respects the rights of California residents under the <a href="https://www.oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">California
Consumer Privacy Act</a>
(CCPA)]. Where we collect information that is subject to the
CCPA, that information we collect and your rights are described below.</p>
<p>Categories of personal information we collect:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Personal Identifiers</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Name and email address when you create an account. You will also
be asked to create a username and we will assign one or more
unique identifiers to your profile. We use this information to
provide our services, respond to your requests, and send
information to you.</p>

<li><p>We also collect your social media handle and basic account
information if you provide it to us or interact with our
services, such as our help desk, through social media.</p>

employment with us, information about your employment history.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Education information:</em> If you apply for employment with us,

<p>We may disclose any of the categories of personal information listed
above and use them for the above-listed purposes or for other business
or operational purposes compatible with the context in which the
personal information was collected. Our disclosures of personal
information include disclosures to our &quot;service providers,&quot; which are
companies that we engage for business purposes to conduct activities
on our behalf. The categories of service providers with whom we share
information and the services they provide are described below.</p>
<p>Rights under CCPA:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Access/Right to Know</em>: You have the right to request access to
personal information we collected about you and information
regarding the source of that personal information, the purposes
for which we collect it, and the third parties and service
providers with whom we share it.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Deletion</em>: You have the right to request that we erase data we have
collected from you. Please note that we may have a reason to deny
your deletion request or delete data in a more limited way than

</li>
</ul>
<p>To exercise your rights above, you can email us at
<a href="mailto:privacy@npmjs.com">privacy@npmjs.com</a>. When we
process your request, we must verify your identity by asking you to
(1) provide personal identifiers that we can match against information
we may have collected from you previously; and (2) confirm your
request using the email stated in the request.</p>
<p>Opt-out of sale:</p>
<p>California residents have the right to request that we stop &quot;selling&quot;
their personal information. A &quot;sale&quot; of personal information is
defined broadly: &quot;selling, renting, releasing, disclosing,
disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise
communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a
consumer&#39;s personal information by the business to another business or
a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration.&quot; We do not
sell your information as defined by the CCPA.</p>
<p>Please note that your right to opt out does not apply to our sharing
of personal information with service providers, who are parties we
engage to perform a function on our behalf and are contractually
obligated to use the Personal Information only for that function.</p>
<p>We may also disclose information to other entities who are not listed
here when required by law or to protect our Company or other persons,
as described in our Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2 id="-a-id-access-how-can-i-see-what-data-is-publicly-available-about-me-a-"><a id="access">How can I see what data is publicly available about me?</a></h2>
<p>You can access your account data at any time by visiting your account
page on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">www.npmjs.com</a>. Your
account page also lists all the packages published under your account or
other accounts.</p>
<p>You can access package data by downloading the packages, as long as
they&#39;re public or you have permission to access them.</p>
<p>You can see metadata about packages by running npm info $package, or by
accessing the appropriate <a href="https://github.com/npm/registry/tree/master/docs">registry&#39;s
API</a>.
Registry APIs provide metadata in standard <a href="https://www.json.org/">JSON</a>
format, and packages as

<h2 id="-a-id-change-how-can-i-change-data-about-me-a-"><a id="change">How can I change data about me?</a></h2>
<p>You can change your personal account data and payment card data at any

<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">www.npmjs.com</a>. You can change
account and payment data for Enterprise by <a href="mailto:support@npmjs.com">emailing
support@npmjs.com</a>.</p>
<p>You can close your npm account at any time by e-mailing
<a href="mailto:support@npmjs.com">support@npmjs.com</a>. Closing
your account removes the profile from the public registry but does not
automatically erase packages published under your account. We may retain
some data about you internally even where you close your account.</p>
<p>npm&#39;s <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/policies/unpublish">unpublish policy</a>
determines when you can erase packages from the npm public registry. The
unpublish policy strikes a difficult balance between the purpose of
publishing and hosting packages, others&#39; reliance on what has been made
public, and individual rights and freedoms.</p>
<p>If another user improperly publishes personal data about you, in a
package or otherwise, <a href="mailto:privacy@npmjs.com">email
privacy@npmjs.com</a>.</p>
<p>Please note that while <a href="#erasure-notice">npm publishes notices about published data
that&#39;s been erased</a>,
npm can&#39;t make everyone who has downloaded published package data or
account data erase that data on your behalf. Choosing a public
license, such as an open source software license,
may encourage and allow storage, distribution, and use of package data
indefinitely. Nearly all popular open source software licenses actually
require preserving personal data that attributes the software to you,
such as copyright notices, as a condition of permission for the
software.</p>

<li><p>npm publishes new placeholder versions of some erased packages, with
<code>README</code> files that mention the package has been erased, and why.</p>
</li>
<li><p>npm&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/npm/registry/tree/master/docs">registry APIs</a>,
special software services that others use to copy data from the
